#+TITLE: Lab discussion

* Info

- Duration between 1:45-2:00h (a rehearsal is highly suggested)
- The presentation must be shared at least one day before the lab, with any dependency needed to run the lab
- The report must be delivered the day after the lab. More or less 10 pages, should allow anybody not attending the class to do the same exercises
- Evaluation is individual, and every team member must take part at the presentation

* Possible lab structure
- Brief introduction :: What is vulnerability assesment? And what is OpenVAS?
- Exercises proposal :: We can propose 3 exercises
  - All the exercises require one VM with OpenVAS and one VM acts as the target
  - With each exercise we should aim at a sweet spot between triviality and heaviness
  - A 4th exercise may be proposed if some time is left
