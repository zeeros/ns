#+TITLE: Vulnerabilities

* Overview

A *bug* is a problem in the execution of the software that leads to unexpected behaviour. The problem must be replicable, meaning that in the same conditions the same unexpected behaviour manifests. If the problem is documented, its not a bug but a *feature*. A bug has a type (logic, configuration, design, implementation) and fix priority.

A *vulnerability* is a bug that causes a security breach or a violation of the system's security policy. The grand majority of vulnerabilities are *undisclosed*, many organizations (such as MITRE) try to discover them and the number of discloses vulnerabilities steadily increases. Vulnerabilities can involve configuration, infrastructure or software, but we will focus on the latter.

* Discovery

Vulnerabilities may be discovered
- Internally :: With a Quality and Assurance (Q&A) process, and once the vulnerability is patched the customer must be informed.
- Externally :: Today vendors are liable for their vulnerabilities, many big companies take part to bounty markets where white hat hackers are reward for finding new vulnerabilities.

** Tools and techniques

The standard, dull way to search for vulnerabilities is via
- Vulnerability scanning :: Check and report using a knowledge base of vulnerabilities with no exploitation (e.g. OpenVAS, Metasploit) with two possible mode.
  - Black box :: Scan made by an external entity with no privileged knowledge.
  - Grey box :: Scan made by an internal or partially internal user, requiring a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).
- Penetration testing :: Given a list of vulnerabilities, test their exploitability without concluding the attack at the very end (e.g. Metasploit). A NDA is always required.

When running these tools, the real difference is made by who is actually running them: the expertise of the tester can enhance the baseline of the tool. Whoever, given the large amount possible vulnerabilities, a team of specialized experts is usually required to discover the most insidious vulnerabilities. A vertical, deep, low-level understanding of the system/software design is often required. Uncommon skills may be required to find many vulnerabilities.

* Handling

The ISO 30111 standard is one of the standards regulating vulnerability handling by regulating the following phases
- Acceptance :: Provide entry points for internal or external sources to report vulnerabilities.
- Verification :: A report is investigated to find out if it is a vulnerability, if it affects a supported version of some software the vendor maintains, if it is exploitable. At this point, a root cause analysis is conducted and possibly identify similar vulnerabilities. Finally, the threat should evaluated and its solution proritized.
- Resolution :: A solution to the vulnerability is defined depending on its type
  - Configuration :: Simply provide guidelines/advises for a correct configuration.
  - Code :: Provide a patch, timing depends on release schedule.
  - Critical :: Provide mitigations before patch is released.
- Release :: Once the resolution has been tested, they can be released via different channels
  - Push to web-services :: Customer subscribes to the service and receives the patch.
  - Pull stand-alone product :: Customer has to actively reach the new product version.
- Post-release :: Provide customer support.

* Disclosure

The ISO 29147 standard regulates the information exchange between vulnerability finders, vendors and possible coordinators. Related to de-facto standards include STIX and TAXII.

Reports on vulnerabilities contain *confidential information* that is considered sensitivel by vendors, so reporting should happen only through a secure communication channel. Depending on the vendors policies, information about the vulnerability may be (or not) published, if so always after a patch release.

The *reward system* can be tricky since external finders have to communicate only the right amount of info to get rewarded. Agreement between researcher and vendor must be protected. Often a third party mediator is involved to hold the vulnerability info for a certain amount of time (60-90 days), and after this period the vulnerability is disclosed. Also the notion of fair reward is controversial (e.g. money, credits).

A *zero day vulnerability* is a vulnerability disclosed before a patchfor it is released and are the target of the most effective and interesting attacks.

Vulnerabilities may be disclosed via a
- Public database :: National Vulnerability Database (NDV), a public NIST-maintained database of discosed vulnerabilities. Each entry has a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE), a list of systems affected by the vulnerability (provided by vendors, not always reliable).
- Private feeds :: Specialized, paid services that release weekly/monthly information.

Several communities and initiatives have been trying to classify vulnerabilities
- Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), now quite outdated
- Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

The Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) is an export group that handles security incidents and can be contacted to report vulnerabilities when the organization doesn't provide an access point to do so.

* Grading

A common metrics system must provide a consistent severity assessment and communication. The *Common Vulnerability Scoring System* (*CVSS*) is an open framework that provides a consistent severity assessment and communication of vulnerabilties. With *CVSS v3* we have three metric groups (basic, temporal, environmental) to group different characteristics. The basic metrics groups characteristics constant over time and environment.

[[./img/cvss_metrics.jpg]]

The *exploitability metrics* collect characteristics of the vulnerable component
- Attack vector :: Measures the level of access required to exploit a vulnerability (=network, adjacent network, local, physical=), higher for exploits that can be executed remotely.
- Attack complexity :: Measures the factors outside of the attacker’s control that are required to exploit the vulnerability (=high, low=), higher for exploits that require additional work on the attacker’s part. An =high= complexity might include target-specific reconnaissance (e.g. configuration, settings, sequence numbers, shared secrets), prepare the target environment (e.g. repeated exploits to win a race condition), MITM.
- Priviliges required :: Measures the privileges required for the attacker to conduct the exploit (=high, low, none=), higher for exploits that require administrative privileges.
- User interaction :: Measures if the attacker must recruit a participant in order to complete the exploit (=required, none=), higher if the attacker can operate autonomously.

In general, a scope is a set of priviliges defined by a security authority (e.g. Adobe, W10), that grants access to resources (e.g. memory, CPU, storage) through identification and authorization. A scope change happens when a vulnerability on a component (e.g. OS) affects the resources governed by another authority (e.g. web browser).

The *scope metric* relates to whether a vulnerability in one component can propagate to other components (=unchaded, changed=). The scope score is higher if propagation is possible. Examples of scope include ability to access and exploit the underlying operating system after exploiting a vulnerability in a software application, or an attacker accessing a backend database after successfully exploiting a vulnerability in a web server.

The impacted component may be different from the vulnerable one, if they are the same then both exploitability and impact metrics refer to just that component. The *impact metrics* measures the impact over the CIA triad for the impacted component (=high, low, none=).

What is the Difference between *CVSS* and *CVE*? CVE stands for Common Vulnerability Enumeration, which is a unique identifier for each vulnerability listed in the NIST NVD. CVSS provides an indication of the severity of each CVE.

The CVE format is as follows: =CVE-[4 Digit Year]-[Sequential Identifier]=

For example, the CVE for the Heartbleed vulnerability is CVE-2014-0160, which means that it was the 160th vulnerability categorized in the NVD in 2014. Its Base CVSS Score is 7.5 (High).

* Social engineering

Security is always about users, so people, and their interaction with systems is a key aspect of security: attacks are usually delivered at the weakest, less expensive link of the system chain, and often people are part of it. Often organizations overlook the human element (cit. Mitnick).

In information security, *social engineering* is used to decept individuals into sharing confidential or personal information that can be use for fraudulent actions. The means include technical, non-technical and manipulations of social interaction as means.

The *Elaboration Likelihood Model* (*ELM*) is used to decribe how stimuli influence and persuade judgement on humans through
- Central route :: Stimuli are rationally evaluated with careful elaboration.
- Periphal route :: Stimuli are under-analyzed with a superficial effort. This route can be used to persuade victims to act in a certain way. Human persuasion should take into account one fo the following factors: reciprocity, consistency, social proof, likeability, authority and scarcity.

** Phishing

With *phishing* an attacker aims to steal users credentials by replicating, using specific tools, the original website. The user, unaware of being decepted into a replica site, shares his credentials to the attacker. Phishing can also be delivered by
- Exploiting other vulnerabilities, such as spoofing web address (a web browser vulnerability).
- Minor differences from the original address (e.g. apps.facebook.com vs app.facebook.com).
- Vishing (Voice phishing), smishing (SMS phishing)

Attacks are usually executed in a multi-stage  and targeted fashion, like in *spear phishing*
1. An initial stage of phishing aims to collect useful information: search through open-source intelligence, plan, prepare, phishing operation, response and capture.
2. Second stage delivers the real phishing attack: re-plan and prepare, spear phishing, response and capture, finally ending with an exploitation.
